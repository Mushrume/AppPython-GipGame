<h1> Gip Game </h1>
<p> This simple game is based on Pig, and involves two players and a six sided die. 
Players roll on their turn for a number between 1 and 6, and can then add this number to their score or roll again.
If they roll again and roll a 1, they lose the score for that round and it is the next players turn.
